    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket 
	at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the 
	bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, 
	and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits
	the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, 
	or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross  </p>
